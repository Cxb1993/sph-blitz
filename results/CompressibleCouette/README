 
Literature on compressible Couette:

1) Anderson: general description

2) Laminar flow analysis
 By David F. Rogers:
chaper 6.3 (p.199, google books): Analytical Solutions of the Compressible NS-Equations - Couette flow
 - describes some special cases with analytical solutions


prepare simulation setup:
----------------------------

Domain size: 1x1
boundary conditions in x-direction: periodic
boundary conditions in y-direction: isothermal no-slip walls (T_upper=1, T_bottom=0)

number of particles: 60x60 (=3600) (like for Taylor-Geen) ->dx=dy=0.01666
supportlength: (like for Taylor-Geen) supLen/dx=2.5


particle initialization:
------------------------




code modifications:
---------------------
law for eta(T) (->Southerland) (equation 15.3, Anderson, fundamentals of aerodynamics)
law for k(T)
law for cv(T) -> not yet implemented
->parameters for Sutherland law are read into material variable!


integrating dissipation in energy equation. ideas:
----------------------------------------

Monaghan gives a roadmap to obtain the viscous heating therm from the viscous force/acceleration
expression (Monaghan2005, section 8.2, before eq (8.13))
1: taking scalar product of viscous force term with v_ij
2:multiplying with m_a (if viscousl acceleration (and not force) is taken
3: summing over all a
(there is a *0.5 also added to the viscous term)

In Espanol we see a similar pattern if we compare the viscous heating term with the viscous force term:
its taking the scalar product with v_ij as well and *0.5.

Unit analysis: eq(31): viscous heating term has units [W]

But there is no summing over a, this is becaus the viscous heating term is expressed for the entropy equation,
(monaghan also shows no summing over a in his entropy equation!)
Might be that the sum_a in equation (8.13) of Monaghan is wrong, because he has the same equation without sum_a as (2.22) 
in MonaghanGingold1983 (a consideration of units also indicates that sum_a is too much)
in Monaghan eq (8.13) (or general in internal energy equation) it has to be added as [W/kg]

->divide expression for viscous heating from espanol by m_i!!!!
