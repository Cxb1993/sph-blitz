For resolution study: the number of particles in x direction was held constant at 2
(domainsize in x direction was the minimum possible of one supportlength) 
In order to get a representative number of particles for the resolution study, not the actual number of particle
is taken (whic would sclae linearly with dx) but an equivalent number of particles supposing the number would have 
in the second direction as well!
