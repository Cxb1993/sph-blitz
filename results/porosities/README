(but unfortunatley I can't access this)

1) A PORE-SCALE NUMERICAL MODEL FOR FLOW
THROUGH POROUS MEDIA (1999)
YI ZHU, PATRICK J. FOX AND JOSEPH P. MORRIS
 - simulates (quasi) incompressible SPH flow through porous media:
   the term "porous media" means in this case: a periodic arrangement of circles (representing the solid).
 - Describes a way of implementing curved boundary conditions
 - for the case of this incompressible flow the pressure variation is MUCH smaller than hydrostatic pressure->
   can give inaccurate results in SPH and therefore only use of dynamic pressure, but I think this does not apply to 
   compressible flows as first our pressure is not to high, and our equation of state is connected to temperature 
  (and a smaller p would therefore influence temperature as well...)???


2) Parallel simulations of pore-scale flow through
porous media(1999)
J.P. Morris, Y. Zhu, P.J. Fox
 - essentially the same as 1), but with emphasis on code parallelization!

3) Modeling Low Reynolds Number Incompressible Flows Using SPH (1997)
Joseph P. Morris, Patrick J. Fox, and Yi Zhu
 - fundamentals for 1) and 2) especially boundary conditions

4) Simulation of Pore-Scale Dispersion in Periodic
Porous Media Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (2002)
Yi Zhu and Patrick J. Fox
 - application of 1),2)



5) SPH as an Inverse Numerical Tool for the Prediction of Diffusive
Properties in Porous Media (2007)
Antonio C.M. Sousa and Fangming Jiang
 - nothing completely new!

6) Porous Flow in Particle-Based Fluid Simulations (2008)
Toon Lenaerts, Bart Adams, Philip Dutre
 - do not model porosities explicitely but by so called "porous particles" containing properties characteristic for 
   porosities ...

7) Mesoscale SPH modeling of fluid flow in isotropic porous media
Fangming Jianga, Mónica S.A. Oliveira and Antonio C.M. Sousa
Computer Physics Communications
Volume 176, Issue 7, 1 April 2007, Pages 471-480 
 - linked to 5): no access to article

8) Pore scale modeling of immiscible and miscible ﬂuid ﬂows using smoothed particle hydrodynamics
   Tartakovsky, A.M., Meakin, P.
   Adv. Water Resour. 29(10), 1464–1478 (2006)
  - Article not accessible

9) Modelling of Power-law Fluid Flow Through Porous
Media Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (2008)
Mehran Vakilha, Mehrdad T. Manzari
 - gives short overview of porosities in SPH
 - use boundary particle modeling according to 10)
