For the case of the 1D oscillation where initialization has been done by 
a sinusoidal velocity profile:  (and p, rho=1= spatially const. @t=0) ther results are as follows:

artificial viscosity turned on for particles approaching each other (compression)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(as it was the case for shock tube simulation)


1. run with supLen=0.03 (as it turned out to be the best supLen for interpolation of a constant value function
			  with spacing dx=0.01, see .ods-sheet)
  - the damping is not exponential (i.e. damping factor not really constant)
  - the periodical time T is not exactly constant for all periods
    (average over 10 first periods is T=0.9728)
    (always keep in mind: can only be as precise as output interval!!!)
  - looking at the "waveMovies" (see gnuplot folder) one notices that p, rho do not return
    to the exact neutral position after half a period (as they theoretically should, as they have been initialized 
    constant..., perhaps that is the cause for the values above (damping, period) not being constant!?!)
    ADDED LATER: no this is not the reason: the reason was the "wrong" support length (see below)
		 but as far as the above comment is concerned, this is probably because an initialization
		 of p, rho=const does not (unlike I initially assumed) correspond to the "equilibrium" configuration
		 and therefore the wave first has to find its "equilibrium" state (p<->rho<->v...)

2. run with smaller smoothing/support length supLen=0.025
    - huge difference to 1.run: 
    - damping almost exactly exponential (damping factor almost constant)
    - T almost constant!
  --> encouraged me to try the exact monaghan value for smoothing length for this case: h=0.013
      ->supLen=2*h=0.026;

3. run with supLen=0.026 (as suggested by Monaghan)
    - results are literally "exact" , little variations in T are due to the output interval of 0.004, otherwise
      periode exactly constant (exact value bewteen 0.864 and 0.868), (compared to variable T's (>=0.94)for supLen=0.03)
    - damping factor very constant, drops a bit starting at period 19....

    ==> Monaghan did not pick the smoothing lenght of h=0.013 for no reason!


artificial viscosity completely turned out
------------------------------------------
(that is actually what Monaghan simulated in his review paper and where he observed practically no
 change in the wave form/amplitude... after 13.7 periods)


1. run wit SupLen=0.026 (dt=0.001 as for all simulations before)
 - the sound wave gets more and more distorted after a certain number of periods. The calculation is not instable
   in the sense that it would diverge, no. But the smallest perturbations (which now, are not damped
   any more) probably lead to the fact that the wave/oscillation "looses" its equilibrium and starts distorting...
   (sometime, the wave looses completely its original form which makes the automatic peak value detection
    during post-processing erroneous. Therefore, post-Processing results after ~10th period are completely wrong)

  perturbations can be seen first in the velocity profile at the instant of 
  crossing the zero line (see VelocProfileAt2_76Periods.png), whereas the form of the profile at the instant
  of maximum velocity still looks unchanged for a couple of periods (see VelocProfileAt3_04Periods.png

  But for the first ~10 periods, results seem very logical and reliable:

  - periodical time T=0.868, exactly constant for the first 10 periods,
    ...and is the same as for simulation with artificial viscosity
    FOLLIWING IS NONSENSE:
    (T<T_withArtificialViscosity, which is logical: 
      omega damped oscillations always < their indamped equivalent --> T_damped > T)

  - damping factor very small, oscillates around zero.

 --> really strange: Monaghan2005 did it, and there were no distortions

2. run with SupLen=0.026, but dt=0.03 (should correspond to Monaghan2005's dt)
 -->does not change anything!?! The only difference is that Monaghan used a "Verlet symplectic integrator",
  but this should really not matter. The solution is not instable, it just gets perturbed and the perturbations
  probably excite different higher harmonic modes..!??! so its nothing unphysical, I would say...


with "global" artificial viscosity (completely turned on)
------------------------------------------
(was done after 1D traveling wave, so there might be some references to that)  

 run wit SupLen=0.026 

    - period T remains the same (as it should)
    - damping increases (as expected) from ~0.057 (for art. visc. with compression only) to now 0.112
      (this is exactly the samoe value as for 1D traveling wave with globally turned on art. visc.
    - besides:  an analog comment I made already for the 1D traveling wave with globally turned on art. visc.
		seems valid here (only that here <<increases>> instead of <<decreases>>):
		  a closer look at the evolution of the damping factor shows: first it increases slightly
		  before it stabilizes around =~0.1112. This could be another indication for the fact, that
		  the wave initialization is not completely exact and that the wave first has to find its
		  "equilibrium position". (I have already speculated about this in 1.) )


DONE LATER (after having found out about the dependency of the periodic time T on the support length (see below...):
- several runs with different smoothing lengths to find the exact T,
- a run with smoothing length<<0.025 to see check if the tendency supLen^,-> T^, and suplen v,-> t v is valid




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

further investigation on the support length sensitivity of wave phenomena

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

so far we know:
---------------
---------------
(from the 1D oscillation simulations conducted with art. visc. turned on for compression)

for a wavelength of lambda=1 and a (mean) particle spacing of dx=0.01 (100 particles)
suplen=0.026 seems to be the optimum value!

A non-optimum value of SupLen leads to:
---------------------------------------
  - a change of the periodical time T:
	for h=0.03: T~0.95 (instead of ~0.867 for optimum supLen)
	for h=0.025: T~0.84 (instead of ~0.867 for optimum supLen)
	Aha! one moment please: T~0.845 is the theoretically exact periodical time!
	and for h=0.025, the other results are not much worse than for h=0.026 (means damping factor
	almost constant as well,...)
	so far I relied on Monaghans value because it seemed the most accurate one, but perhaps
	it is not the exactly good value. Maybe he picked h=0.013 because he incremented h by 0.001
	to find the optimum value...
	...or his criterion was not the periodic time T but the fit with the original shape...???
	So the perfect h (which gives the right T and therefore the right propagation speed)
	would lie somewhere between h=0.0125 and h=0.013 (supLen=0.025 and 0.026)

	=>> SUPPORT  LENGHT (SMOOTHING LENGHT) SEEMS TO INFLUENCE PERIODICAL TIME T AND THEREFORE
	    PROPAGATION SPEED (SOUND SPEED)!!!

  - a non constant damping factor!

    so, before moving on, let's find the "exact" value for the support length!
    we choose our precision +/-0.002 (controled by the simulation data output interval) and
    average take T as the average periodical time of the 10 first periods!
    (we conduct simulations with art Visc globally turned on but that really does not matter, as this does not 
    influence T at all (T=08668 for art. visc. for compresssion and global art visc. ony without art visc has a slightly
    different value, but this is perhaps because the wave gets distorted...)
    dt=0.0005
    output interval time=0.002(=dt*4)

    aimed value			T=0.845 

    1.supLen=0.026			T=0.8668
    2.supLen=0.025			T=0.8404
    3.suplen=0.0255			T=0.853
    4.supLen=0.0252			T=0.8452 (THIS IS OK AS "EXACT" VALUE)


    5.suplen=0.02			T=0.8314 (error 1.6%)
    --> shows that T decreases when supLen decreases)!

    for the optimum case (in terms of T) we have the following ratios:
    a) supLen/lambda=0.0252/1=0.0252  
    b) supLen/dx=0.0252/0.01=2.52
    --> want to find out, if one of those ratios (and if yo, which of them) controls accurary!

    ad a) change lambda!!!
    -----------------------
    expected results: normally it should not make a difference, as Monaghan2005 conducts a simulation
    for lambda=0.2 (with otherwise same configuration) and everything works fine for him!
    
	  - run with lambda=0.2 makes a theoretical T of T=lambda/c=0.169
	    and a ratio supLen/lambda=0.0252*5=0.126
	    (to stay in the same relative precission, use output interval of 0.002/5=0.0004,	
	    adapt timestep dt=0.0004)
	    Results:
		T=0.17068 (again averaged value for 10 first peridos)
		damping: looks good, "constant" value ~0.428
	      => period seems right (within 1%)

	  - run with lambda=0.5 makes a theoretical T of T=lambda/c=0.4226
	    and a ratio supLen/lambda=0.0252*2=0.0504
	    (to stay in the same relative precission, use output interval of 0.002/2=0.001	
	    timestep dt=0.0005)
	    Results:
		T=0.423 (again averaged value for 10 first peridos)
		damping: looks good, "constant" value ~0.201
	      => period seems very good

	  - run lambda=2 makes ttheoretical T of T=lambda/c=1.690
	    and a ratio supLen/lambda=0.0252/2=0.0126
	    ->need to adapt domain: size=2, 200 particles to maintain dx=0.01
	    (to stay in the same relative precission, use output interval of 0.002*2=0.004	
	    timestep dt=0.0005)
	    Results:
		T= 1.6908(again averaged value for 10 first peridos)
		damping: looks about good, almost"constant" value, slight icrease from 0.54->0.56
	      => period literally exact!


    seems as if results were good for all simulations with supLen/lambda=0.025*N and
    supLen/lambda=0.025*1/N with N =1,2,3,...

    test wavelength which does not respect this condition: 
  
	e.g. wavelength=0.75!
	adapt domainsize=0.75, 75 particles..
	theoretical T=0.6339
	Results:
		T= 0.634(again averaged value for 10 first peridos)
		damping: looks  very good, "constant" value ~0.139
	      => period literally exact!
      
	and test another one e.g. lambda=1.3
	adapt domainsize=1.3, 130 particles..
	theoretical T=1.0987

	Results:
		T= 1.0988(again averaged value for 10 first peridos)
		damping: looks good, "constant" value ~0.83-0.84
	      => period literally exact!

  ==> simulation is not very sensitive to wavelength: for supLen=0.0252 and dx=0.01,
      (at least)  one order of magnitude (lambda=0.2 to lambda=2) can be simulated without problems
      FOR LATER: find limits of wavelength (max and min) which can be simulated for given supLen,dx)
    
  ==> so the ratio supLen/lambda can not be the controlling factor!!! 

    ad b) change dx
    -----------------
    maintain supLen=0.0252, wavelength=1 (initial configuration) and vary dx via teh number of particles

    N_particle		dx		supLen/dx		T		damping factor
        
      40		0.025		1.008			-- supLen/dx to small!! no physical result--
      50		0.02		1.26			0.5854		0.03to >0.05
      (wave shape still not physical, because particle distance in expansion/rarefaction part still too big!!!)
     
      64		0.015625	1.6128			0.6442		0.075, very constant
      80		0.0125		2.016			0.8316		~0.11

      100		0.01		2.52			0.8452		~0.108  
      
      110		0.00909...	2.772			0.9126		~0.112

      125		0.008		3.15			0.8754		0.11 to 0.15
      128		0.0078125	3.2256			0.844
      160		0.00625		4.032			0.8386		0.10 to 0.101
      200		0.005		5.04			0.8806		0.1 to 0.12 (wave shape not exact)

VISUALIZATION OF THESE RESULTS WILL BE DONE LATER...
  
compare factor supLen/dx with results from above (where dx=0.01)
for supLen=0.03: supLen/dx=3: 		T=0.9728 *)
for supLen=0.025: supLen/dx=2.5:	T=0.8404
for supLen=0.02: supLen/dx=2:		T=0.8314

observations: 
1. it seems as if the factor supLen/dx played an important role for the simulation of wave behaviour
2. best global solution (in terms of T and damping) for supLen/dx=2.52, sensitivity seems locally
   very high!
3. in terms of T only, there are at least 3 values supLen/dx which gave a good solution 
4. even if it needs further confirmation, it seems as if the couples (supLen/dx, T) obtained with 
   different supLens (0.03, 0.025, 0.02) fit in this set of data (this implies that this ratio could be
   independent of supLen, or dx respectivley)

IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION
  - test if the optimum factor supLen/dx depends on dx, 
  (if suPlen=5,dx=1 is optimum, is supLen10, dx=2 optimum as well??)
  - find out about dependency of optimum factor supLen/dx on amplitude of wave
    ( perhaps the particle displacement (gets bigger with amplitude) and the resulting local 
      asymmetry/particle disorder have an influence..
      determine kind of local ratios supLen/dx (min/max) in expansion and compression zones,
      perhaps they are a more universal criterion...)
