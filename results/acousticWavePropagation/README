Acoustic wave propagation test case

#######################################################

this test case is to assess the numerical dissipation of the SPH method

   Dissipative-acoustic instability in accretion disks at a nonlinear stage
   implement periodic source and initial perturbation: initial perturbation could be interesting for me: equation (19)
   Just don't know yet, how to initialize: is this only a velocity perturbation or do I have to initialize corresponding
   perturbations in pressure, ... as well???

  Free-surface flows solved by means of SPH schemes with numerical diffusive terms 
  can't access full text version of the paper, they have "traveling acoustic waves" as a test case,
  would perhaps e interesting to see, how they initialized their wave(s) (if it is detailed in the paper...)
  Abstract:
      A novel system of equations has been defined which contains diffusive terms in both the continuity and
      energy equations and, at the leading order, coincides with a standard weakly-compressible SPH scheme with
      artificial viscosity. A proper state equation is used to associate the internal energy variation to the
      pressure field and to increase the speed of sound when strong deformations/compressions of the fluid occur.
      The increase of the sound speed is associated to the shortening of the time integration step and, therefore,
      allows a larger accuracy during both breaking and impact events. Moreover, the diffusive terms
      allows reducing the high frequency numerical acoustic noise and smoothing the pressure field.
      Finally, an enhanced formulation for the second-order derivatives has been defined which is consistent
      and convergent all over the fluid domain and, therefore, permits to correctly model the diffusive
      terms up to the free surface. The model has been tested using different free surface flows clearly
      showing to be robust, efficient and accurate. An analysis of the CPU time cost and comparisons with
      the standard SPH scheme is provided.

  NUMERICAL DISSIPATION IN RSPH SIMULATIONS OF ASTROPHYSICAL FLOWS WITH APPLICATION TO PROTOPLANETARY DISKS
  RSPH=Regularized SPH: regularization technique where the solution at temporal intervals is mapped on 
  to a new set of regularly placed particles.
  ->this increases numerical dissipation, therefore this article deals also with numerical dissipation in SPH
  test cases of interest: 
    *linear waves:
     study temporal resolution at fixed sensor point, mainly to	see how the amplitude changes

    *Kelvin Helmholtz Instability:
     study growth of instability, no direct link to dissipation, but could be an interesting 2D inviscid
     test case for me???

- Monaghan2005 ReviewPaper
  in section 6.1 Monaghan studies the dispersion relation for a infinite one dimensional gas
  he finds out that there is good agreement with theorie for small wave numbers,
  for higher wave numbers though, the theoretically linear dispersion relation omega=c_s*k
  is not appoximated "exactly" anymore. (-->higher order kernels better...see. p.1731)
  The same test case (velocity wave) can be taken to test the numerical diffusion of the code (am I right???,
  see also concerns below....)

  little ambiguity still exists because of the initialization:
  Monaghan2005: only velocity wave u(x)=0.05*c_s*sin(2 PI x), density remains constant: pressure not precised
		I will/would do p(x)=p_0-rho/2*v^2(x) as by setting rho=cosnt. it is assumed incompressibe anyway
		and therefore bernoulli can be employed. For Mach numbers of M=0.05 this seems ok.

		Implementation: 

		-domain from x=0 to x=1, boundary conditions in x direction: periodic;
		-Monaghan 1992 review paper ("smoothed particle hydrodynamics", ARAA):
		  good agreement for wave propagation if wavelength> 2*Pi*h (and for us supLen=2*h)
		  that means we need a suplen of <=wavelength/Pi
		  
		-Monaghan2005: 100 particles in area x=0 to x=1: dx=0.01
			       h=const=0.013-> for us: supLen=0.026 
		-CellSize: optimum: cellSize=supLen but domain size/cellsize needs to be integer
		  --> take 32 cells of size 0.03125
	        -simulation is an actual 2D simulation but by not placing any particles in the second
		  dimension it can be artificially made a 1D simulation, boundary condition in y direction
		  preiodic...
		-initial particle distribution: see above, besides y=0 for all particles.
			      
		
		  


	    But I wonder if this is a good test case to study dissipation and I thing acoustic waves require
	    to be modelled with variations of all variables? Should there not rather be an oscillation
	    of all variables. In other words: should I not rather consider it fully compressible and
	    calculate the values of the other variables with the isentropic relations???
