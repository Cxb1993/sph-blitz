1D test case for reflection and superposition of waves

###################################################################################

in this test case one single 1D wave is created by a moving LHS wall.
the wave then travels to the RHS end of the domain (where there is a rigid wall
boundary condition) ans is reflected there. 
At the moment the wave hits the RHS wall, a second wave is generated at the LHS wall,
so they meet in the middle of the domain and interfere with each other.

data:
- domain size: x_domain=2
- number of particles =200 (->dx =0.01) (in file 1DunperturbedDomain.ivs) 
- supLen=0.0252
- pressure P_=1.0
- density rho_0=1.0
-> sound speed c_0=1.183216
- wavelength for the 2 created waves: lambda=0.5
- T=lambda/c_0=0.422577127
- no artificial viscosity!
- dt=T/1000=0.000422577127

- for periodic wall movement: uncomment corresponding code passage in gastimesolverLeapfrog.cpp timeIntegral_Summation()
method!!!


theoretical case:
--------------

at t_0=0
--------
LHS wall starts moving according to u_wall=u_max*sin(omega*t) 
  where omega=2*PI/T=14.86873023, u_max=0.05*c_0=0.05916

at t_1=T=0.422577127
--------
LHS wall stops moving

at t_2=x_domain/c_0=1.690308509
-------------------------------
- wave hits RHS wall
- LHS wall starts moving again according to same equation as above, generating a new wave

at t_3=t_2+T=2.112885637
------------
- LHS wall stops moving
- first wave completely reflected from RHS wall

at t_4=t_3+T
------------
waves start to interfere

at t_5=t_4+T/2
------------
maximum wave interference

at t_6=t_4+T
-----------
wave interference over

at t_7=t_6+T=3.380617019
-----------
- waves hit walls
- simulation ends

numerical results: 
-for the case without artificial viscosity one can again observe the physical instability of the solution.
 small perturbations (probably coming from the discretized wall movement) affect the shape of the waves)
 but otherwise it looks good (reflection and interference work)
 peak velocity values for first wave:

 at t_1/2=T/2:		0.0170374172
 at t_2:		0.0181827137   (even bigger, but probably due to slight change in shape, wave got more pointed)
 at t_3:		0.0162377871   (now wave larger, therefore loss of v_max probably not due to num. dissipation,
					but physical behaviour doue to instabilities)
 at t_5:		0.0335744506   (corresponds quite well to the double of the velocity!)		
 at t_7:		0.0154534525   (again wave has become larger...)

I ran the simulation also with artificial viscosity, where the instabilities disappeared. Due to the damping,
there is no conservation of v_max, that is why I did not extract numerical values for that case.
But there is a little sequence of images which shows the overall behaviour...
