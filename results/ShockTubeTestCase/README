Remarks on the evaluation of the simulation results:

- the error of simulated data compared to the exact solution is measured by the L_1 norm: ||E||_1 =SUM |E_i,Nt| 
  where E_i,Nt is the error vector for particle i at the time(step) Nt. The error vector E consists of 
  the three variables rho, u, e, E=(rho,u,e) (p =rho*R*T, T=e/cv and so p is not independant of those 3 variables.
  Therefore there is no need to include p in this consideration) 

  Remark: in order for the cumulated error ||E||_1 to be independant of the spacial ressolution it is divided
  by the number of particles N in the (considered) domain. (Others multiply it with dx which is based on the same principle,
  but as for the particular case of an SPH shock tube there is not necessarily a constant particle spacing, 
  a divison by N is preferred)

- furthermore the relative (NO, THE ABSOLUTE, as relative nonsens for 0) error for each variable (rho,p, u,e) is determined for each particle position 
  (as well as the average (NO, THE CUMMULATED) value over all particles)

- due to the smoothing effect, the shock resolution is always a bit problematic, Monaghan2005 therefore states
  that the after shock values are a better benachmark for the precission of the method than the actual shock resolution.
  To measure the precission of the after shock values, an additional L1 norm calculation is added for both the area
  behind rarefaction (to discontinuity) (area 3) and the area behind shock (to discontinuity) (area 2) separately.
