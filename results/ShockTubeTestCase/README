Remarks on the evaluation of the simulation results:

- the error of simulated data compared to the exact solution is measured by the L_1 norm: ||E||_1 =SUM |E_i,Nt| 
  where E_i,Nt is the error vector for particle i at the time(step) Nt. The error vector E consists of 
  the three variables rho, u, e, E=(rho,u,e) (p =rho*R*T, T=e/cv and so p is not independant of those 3 variables.
  Therefore there is no need to include p in this consideration) 

  Remark: in order for the cumulated error ||E||_1 to be independant of the spacial ressolution it is divided
  by the number of particles N in the (considered) domain. (Others multiply it with dx which is based on the same principle,
  but as for the particular case of an SPH shock tube there is not necessarily a constant particle spacing, 
  a divison by N is preferred)

- furthermore the relative error for each variable (rho,p, u,e) is determined for each particle position 
  (as well as the average value over all particles)
