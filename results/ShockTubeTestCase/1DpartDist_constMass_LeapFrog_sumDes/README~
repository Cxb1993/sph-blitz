Logbook for resolution study with constant mass particle distribution 

#########################################################################

as automatic time control is implemented, the temporar resolution study
will not be conducted.

remark: in the case of constant Mass particle distribution, the particle distances dx_l, dx_r
	will be controlled by the particle mass. e.g. a decrease in m by the factor 2 will result in
	a decrease in dx_l, dx_r by 2 as well.

1. support length variation
  intended to check if the optimum support length is about the same as for the consSpacing

  Results:
  global optimum at supLen around 0.25 (as for constantSpacing) but for 0.025 already very small oscillations
  in u in areas 2,3 and results get worse very quick if supLen further decreased. Therefore we retain the supLen 0.03 
  wit mass 0.001875 , which gives ratio supLen/mass=16.
  There are no major oscillations observed for a medium supLen (as it was the case for constant spacing) and 
  there is n bump in u for the rarefaction at all

2. constant ratio supLen/m =16 (where mass equivalent to particle spacing)
