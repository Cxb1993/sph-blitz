resolution study with constant mass 2D particle distribution 

#########################################################################
 
Remark: it is not obvious to find a convenient 2D particle distribution for the constant mass approach
	(at least not for the shock tube values, that are employed in the previous studies: rho_l/rho_r=8)
	The reason for this is the following:
	To respect the initial density ratio rho_l/rho_r with an constant mass approach (m_l=m_r),
	the initial particle spacings for the left and right hand side need to be (supposing that dx=dy):
	dx_r=sqrt(rho_l/rho_r)*dx_l
	At the same time, the number of particles in y direction calculated by (N_l&r=cell_size/dy_l&r) must 
	be an integer for both sides (as they have to be placed in the cells in a way that allows for a periodical
	continuation of the domain in y direction.)
	
	For a density ratio of 8, I could not find an appropriate particle distribution. One possibility to
	avoid this problem (or better to diminuish the effects of the conflict at the cell limit) is to
	increase the domain size in y direction which for the moment and to safe calculation time is the
	minimum possibly size (which is one cell=one support length). But increasing the number of cells
	in y direction would lead to a considerable increase in calculation time, which for this simple resolution
	study is not acceptable (the highest resolution for 2D particle distribution with constant spacing took 
	little less than 3 hours).

	So I decided to choose a different density ratio for the reference shock tube case; one which 
	is a square number. As 9 is the closest square number to the original density ration of 8, I picked this one.
	This way, both sides can be filled with particles in a way that allows for a periodical
	continuation of the domain in y direction. 
	And the validity of the study is not affected, as the exact solution, of course, is also calculated for 
	this new shock tube configuration (rho_l=1,rho_r=0.111111111(=1/9)). All other values remain the same as before
	
	to create the particle distribution, I selected a particle mass which would lead to dx_r=0.015
	(the same dx as for the right hand side of the 1D particle distribution with constant mass). This way I
	expected to find the optimum support lenght in the sae order of magnitude as in 1D...

	Another point is: if I wanted to simulate only with optimum cell size (=support length) I could change
	the support length only in steps of size dx_r=0.015. As this is a very rough step, I will also simulate
	support lengths in between by diminuishing the support length while maintaining the cell size. This in not
	ideal in terms of computational time, but it does not affect the quality of the results.

1. support length variation at constant mass m=2.5e-5 
(corresponds to constant particle spacing dx_l=dy_l=0.005, dx_r=dy_r=0.015)
