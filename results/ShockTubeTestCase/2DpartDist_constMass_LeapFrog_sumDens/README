resolution study with constant mass 2D particle distribution 

#########################################################################
 
Remark: it is not obvious to find a convenient 2D particle distribution for the constant mass approach
	(at least not for the shock tube values, that are employed in the previous studies: rho_l/rho_r=8)
	The reason for this is the following:
	To respect the initial density ratio rho_l/rho_r with an constant mass approach (m_l=m_r),
	the initial particle spacings for the left and right hand side need to be (supposing that dx=dy):
	dx_r=sqrt(rho_l/rho_r)*dx_l
	At the same time, the number of particles in y direction calculated by (N_l&r=cell_size/dy_l&r) must 
	be an integer for both sides (as they have to be placed in the cells in a way that allows for a periodical
	continuation of the domain in y direction.)
	
	For a density ratio of 8, I could not find an appropriate particle distribution. One possibility to
	avoid this problem (or better to diminuish the effects of the conflict at the cell limit) is to
	increase the domain size in y direction which for the moment and to safe calculation time is the
	minimum possibly size (which is one cell=one support length). But increasing the number of cells
	in y direction would lead to a considerable increase in calculation time, which for this simple resolution
	study is not acceptable (the highest resolution for 2D particle distribution with constant spacing took 
	little less than 3 hours).

	So I decided to choose a different density ratio for the reference shock tube case; one which 
	is a square number. As 9 is the closest square number to the original density ration of 8, I picked this one.
	This way, both sides can be filled with particles in a way that allows for a periodical
	continuation of the domain in y direction. 
	And the validity of the study is not affected, as the exact solution, of course, is also calculated for 
	this new shock tube configuration (rho_l=1,rho_r=0.111111111(=1/9)). All other values remain the same as before
	
	to create the particle distribution, I selected a particle mass which would lead to dx_r=0.015
	(the same dx as for the right hand side of the 1D particle distribution with constant mass). This way I
	expected to find the optimum support lenght in the sae order of magnitude as in 1D...

	Another point is: if I wanted to simulate only with optimum cell size (=support length) I could change
	the support length only in steps of size dx_r=0.015. As this is a very rough step, I will also simulate
	support lengths in between by diminuishing the support length while maintaining the cell size. This in not
	ideal in terms of computational time, but it does not affect the quality of the results.

1. support length variation at constant mass m=2.5e-5 
(corresponds to constant particle spacing dx_l=dy_l=0.005, dx_r=dy_r=0.015) 

  Results: 
  the best global results are obtained for h=0.03 (with m=2.5e-5) resulting in a ratio supLen/sqrt(m)=6. (for 2D
  one has to take sqrt(m) because the spacing is ~ sqrt(m)

  However due to the discontiutity of the particle distribution in y direction at the interface, there is 
  a very weak drifting of the interface particles on the high density side in y direction. Given the	
  particle distribution, this behaviour is physical and the newly assumed particle positions probably
  correspond to the equilibrium positions for this constellation. So no reason to worry...

  Besides, within the rarefaction wave, there is still a bump in the velocity profile for most of the simulated cases.
  It only disappeares for supLen>=0.4.
  This bump was encountered in 1D for constant spacing, but not for constan mass particle distribution.
  In 2D it was encountered for constant spacing (as expeected) but now also for constant mass simulations unless
  supLen is very big.
  
2. suport length variation with ratio support length/sqrt(m)=6=const
  
  convergence to the exact solution can be observed.
  however, within the rarefaction wave, there is still a bump in the velocity profile (even for high resolutions).
  
3. single simulation with suplen=0.1, supLen/sqrt(m)=8
  To try out, if a highly resolved result (supLen=0.01) can be obtained without this bump, I tried one simulation with a 
  ratio supLen/sqrt(m)=8. This corresponds to the case supLen=0.04 in 1.) 
  This calculation took easily  3 hours: 
      - 10656 real particles, 
      - dt<~0.0005 (410 steps), 
      - size of interaction list (at t=0): 1,201,907 
  Result: the bump inside the rarefaction wave is gone, but it seems ( at least visually) as if the (compared to the
	  particle spacing) high supLen lead to the fact that after shock/after rarefaction values are not reached exactly
	  any more....???
  quantitative comparison of the errors with the simulation support length/sqrt(m)=6 (both wit supLen=0.1):
  
                 |    L1    |    L2    |   Linf    |   L1_3   |    L2_3   |   Linf_3  |   L1_2   |   L2_2   |  Linf_2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supLen/sqrt(m)=6 |0.0228742 |0.0161848 |0.0136212  |0.0111649 |0.0073220  |0.0059373  |0.0094088 |0.0084059 |0.0082920
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supLen/sqrt(m)=8 |0.016035  |0.0111414 |0.00934318 |0.013261  |0.00814581 |0.00628067 |0.0132    |0.0103663 |0.00968592

  this shows that the visual impression was right: While the globar error (domain +/-0.5 diaphragm) is less
  for supLen/sqrt(m)=8 (probably due to the absence of the bump in the rarefaction wave), the "local" errors 
  in the two areas after shock (2) and after rarefaction (3) have increased, confirming the observation from above.
