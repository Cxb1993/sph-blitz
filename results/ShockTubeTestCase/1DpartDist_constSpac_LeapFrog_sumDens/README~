Explanation on the resolution study

##################################################### 

perliminary remark on numbers in folder names: 
as folder names do not support decimals, only the positions after 
the decimal point are indicated, implicitly assuming "0."


1. a temporal resolution study is conducted, which aimes at verifying if
  the time step dt=0.0025 is suffuciently small for the temporal discretization
  error to be negligeable. This study is perfomed with a spacing of dx=0.005 and
  a support length of 0.03 (other simulation settings are as folder name specifies).

  Result: instability is triggered by the area between discontinuity and shock (by oscillations in u)
  simulation diverges starting at dt>~0.005 and below still has (partly) severe oscillations . 
  For dt<=0.0025, no (major/instable) oscillations any more-->dt=0.0025 (at least for this spacing dx=0.005)
  WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE IG THE RESULTS DEPEND ON THE PARTICLE SPACING, THEREFORE:
  later I will make a set of simulations with a considerably different particle spacing and see if the temporal
  error converges for the same time dt=0.0025!!!

  anyway for further simulations dt=0.0025

2. a spatial resolution study is conducted by varying the supportlength for constant dx=0.005

  Results: globally a support length of 0.025 gives the best results for this spacing. This corresponds to a
  ratio supLen/dx=5 (8 nearest neighbouring particles (NNP) in 1D, which is very close to the number given in 
  literature for 1D (around 6); the results are still very good vor a supLen of 0,02 which would exactly 
  correspond to 6 NNP, but 0.02 is at the edge of instability, therefore 0.025 is kept)

3. for the ratio supLen/dx=5, make a resolution study.

  Results: for supLen0.015,dx0.03, huge oscillations in u (between discontinuity and schock)
  -->same as in 2, when dt too big
  
  some notes on literature search for SPH time stepping:
  -	there exists a "individual time step method" (ind. time step for each particle), not of interest for us,
	("A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR INDIVIDUAL TIME STEPS IN SPH SIMULATIONS")
  -	monaghan 1992 (smoothed particle hydrodynamcis) suggests a time step control similar to the one for weakly 
	compressible flows implemented in hydrodynamics.cpp (Hu, Adams). I am going to implement this one tomorrow,
	in order to get rid of the temporal effect. So for the further resolution study, I can be sure that any occurring
	instability/divergence is due to spacial resolution (and not temporal...)
	monaghan1989 (on the problem of penetration in particle methods) uses the same 
	(but earlier version with slight differences) (in 1992 there seems to be something wrong with the signs of mue_ab
	  therefore I use monaghan1989 for that)
	IMPLEMENT MONAGHAN: 
	*new method GetTemistepGas in hydrodynamics.cpp
	*new attribute mue_ab_max for particle
	*mue_ab_max is determined in interaction::updateForces() (for summation density)
	  (is called there (in new notation of Monaghan 2005 review paper) phiij, only sign has to be inversed)
	*mue_ab_max is determined in interaction::updateForcesAndRho() (for continuity density)
	  (is called there (in new notation of Monaghan 2005 review paper) phiij, only sign has to be inversed)
	*mue_ab_max is reset to zero (with new method: hydrodynamics::zero_mue_ab_max()) directly after 
	hydrodynamics:GetTimestepGas(ini) is called in gastimesolver:TimeIntegralSummation
	ok, compiles. first test with supLen=0.03, dx=0.005 (was good with manual time control and dt=0.0025)
	-->timesteps of the order 3e-5 (way to small) and even getting constantly smaller...
	--> in monaghan1992 there was no sqrt in the equation for d_f, added sqrt as in Monaghan 1989!
	--> works just fine (dt around 0.0016, good!)
	
  Resume resolution study, now with automatic timecontrol. 
  (for automatic time control, the aimed simulation time of 0.2s can not be guaranteed, I always take
  the closest adjacent time for the resolution study. The error should be minimal as the exact result
  will be calculated with the precise time value for each simulation.
   
  restart with suplen=0.025, dx=0.005.....
  ...until supLen=0.005, dx=0.001 (then simulation takes already very long, 2000 particles, dt around 2.7e-4.., 
  about 640 time steps)
  
  Results:
  simulation gets as exact as wanted EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE BUMP IN VELOCITY WITHIN THE RAREFACTION???
  global error (where this bumb is negligeable) decreases in a linear
