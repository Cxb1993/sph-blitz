random particle distribution in literature:

Monaghan 2005 review paper:
- one approach: giving each particle a short wavelength disorder (see Colagrossi2004)
  BUT: this kind of disorder does not usually occurr during simulation IF particle spacing<< dominant length scale
  -->errors due to disordered particle positions in general much smaller than expected if 
    randomly placed particles are assumed.

Rasio & Shapiro 1991(Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 (ISSN 0004-637X), vol. 377, Aug. 20, 1991, p. 559-580):
  - mention and even calculated shock tube problem with randomly distributed particle  (2.2.1), calculates
    a 1D shock in a 3D domain: "particles randomly distributed in each constant density domain" and 
    "equal mass particles" and even "constand number of neighbors" HOW CAN THAT BE ACHIEVED TECHNICALLY???
  - speakesof another paper where he conducted more of those tests, but has not been published yet at that time

Graham, Huhges 2007(Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 2008; 56:1261â€“1269)
  - study the influence of random particle position initialization for viscous flows
