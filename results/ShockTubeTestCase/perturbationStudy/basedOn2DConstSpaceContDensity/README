perturbation study 2D const spacing

Results
-------

the 2D particle distribution seems to be more resistant to disordered particles than the 1D distribution.
For little particle disorder the global results get even better than for regular distribution. But this is 
probably mainly due to the fact that this bump in the rarefaction wave almost disappears and that the
over-estimation of velocity after rarefaction wave is less...
The disordered results are generally less "smooth" than the ones with regular particle distribution. One can
see many small oscillations (especially in u, e profile, not that much in density profile)
