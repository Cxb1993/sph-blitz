perturbation study for 1D particle distribution
(particles perturbed from constant mass configuration)

1. reference solution for non disturbed particle distribution with supLen=0.02, mass=0.00125
   (where m is obtained by smoothing...)
  
   just by curiosity: 
   comparison of the results of this simulation with the corresponding simulation where m is directly
   calculated based on the particle spacing m=rho*dx and this way initialized via the external .ivs file

    -->smoothed mass calculation results are not as accurate as the ones with m=rho*dx

2. variation of the perturbation factor<<fac>> in the <<scripts/create_IC1D_SpaceConstRAND.cpp>> program;
   <<fac>> is the maximum value in percent of dx of the uniform perturbation with mean 0.

  the integrated values (velocity u, energy e) are mostly affected by the perturbation (resulting in oscillations),
  whereas density (obtained by smoothing) still agrees reasonably with the theoretical solution (see, eg pert=0.25).
  This is an indication for the fact, that the derivative approximation is mainly affected by disordered particles, not
  the interpolation of the function value itself, which is used for density calculation.
  (The actual function interpolation should be "exact" as long as there are particles in the support...).
  (search for references...e.g Quinlain2006,...)

  But why are then oscillations in the reults even in the areas, which neither shock nor rarefaction have reached yet:
    This is because the derivative is not approximated correctly and therefore it is not zero (as it should be). 
    particles therefore change their properties...

 for greater perurbations, the after-shock/after-perturbation values are not reproduced exactly any more.


  besides: the perturbation mainly affects the right hand side of the shock tube. As the particle spacing is much 
	   bigger there, the absolute value of the perturbation is greater as well. With constant supportLength, 
	   the effect of particle disorder has a bigger influence on the RHS, where there are much less particles
	   within the suport domain than on the LHS.
