	How to visualize the results with gnuplot

###########################################################################

Once a simulation has been conducted and the postprocessing results have been
obtained (according to <<sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessing/README>>):


 1.in the directroy <<sph-blitz/results/ResultsInProgress>> run either 
   the <<compareResErrbars.sh>> or the <<compareResults.sh>> shell script
   depending on whether errorbars shall be added to the figure or not.
   In order for gnuplot to find the good files, both scripts need the time (in
   ms 8 digits) as an additional input argument. The syntax to run the script
   is for example:
   <<./../../gnuplot/shockTube_q1D/compareResults.sh 00200000>>

      both scripts will create 8 figures (2x4, one for r, p, u, e; in .eps and .png)

      both of the scripts also copy the original simulation result file prtlxxxxxxxx.dat from
      ..src/outdata to ..results/ResultsInProgress, so it is not lost.

 2. if, in addition, a visualization of the scattering of the particles is desired, the script 
    <<visualizeScattering.sh>> can be executed (also in <<sph-blitz/results/ResultsInProgress>>)
    
  <<./../../gnuplot/shockTube_q1D/visualizeScattering.sh 00200000>>

for perturbation study:
-----------------------
execute first the script <<compareResults.sh>> (as for "normal" simulation), 
execute then the script <<visualizeScatteringRAND.sh>>
it will create additionally the following figures:
(in the newly created folder <<particlePositionsAndCo>>)
in <<..results/ResultsInProgress>>
<<./../../gnuplot/shockTube_1D/compareResults.sh xxxxxxxx>>, where xxxxxxxx is the time stamp of the simulation
  
  - figure showing the (perturbed) initial particle distribution (pos00000000.png/eps)
  - figure showing the mass for each particle ((mass00000000.png/eps)
  - figure showing the initial density profile (should correspond exactly to the initial conditions)
