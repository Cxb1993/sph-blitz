	How to visualize the results with gnuplot

###########################################################################

Once a simulation has been conducted and the postprocessing results have been
obtained (according to <<sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessing/README>>):

1. copy the file containing the simulation results (e.g. prtl00200000.dat)
   you want to compare from <<sph-blitz/src/outdata>> into
   <<sph-blitz/results/ResultsInProgress>> (this way the result will not be overwritten 
  once a new simulation is performed)

2. in the directroy <<sph-blitz/results/ResultsInProgress>> run either 
   the <<compareResErrbars.sh>> or the <<compareResults.sh>> shell script
   depending on whether errorbars shall be added to the figure or not.
   In order for gnuplot to find the good files, both scripts need the time (in
   ms 8 digits) as an additional input argument. The syntax to run the script
   is for example:
   <<./../../gnuplot/shockTube_1D/compareResults.sh 00200000>>
    
  Remark: the figures have not yet reached their "final" status, there are still 
  some very small bugs, but at the moment I want rather make some progress than fixing this:
  the little problem (at least for 1D particle distribution) lies at the contact discontinuity: 
  One might think that the exact result
  as shown in the figure is erroneous. The calculation whereas is correct. This little, ugly
  "oscillation" at the contact discontinuity is only a matter of graphical representation of gnuplot,
  not a calculation error: 
  The exact results are calculated at each particle position as resulted from the simulation. 
  As there LHS particle at the very interface passes the RHS particle at the interface during simulation,
  those two particles (which in the data file are sorted on their ID) are in the "wrong" order for gnuplot
  (concerning their x position)
  A remedy will be that I sort the particle data file for 1D simulation as well 
  (as already done for q1D simulation)...
  But at the moment I will leave it like this, as the numerical errors are not affected by this graphical issue.

  seond remark concerns the discontinuities for the exact results: 
  on the figures it may seem as if the discontinuities were not really discontinuous, even for the exact solution.
  In this case one has to keep in mind, that the exact solution is calculated ony at the particle position, everything
  in between is automatically interpolated by gnuplot. Again the numerical results are exact (as comparison is only 
  made at the particle positions)
  
  

   the scripts will create 8 figures (2x4, one for r, p, u, e; in .eps and .png)
