 
 
showProfile.sh:
----------------
- has to be run with the timestamp of the desired instant (12 digits) as input argument
  ./compProfiles xxxxxxxxxxxx
- creates an .eps and .png called <<U_profilexxxxxxxxxxxx._ _ _ >> for visualization of 
  simu result using prtlxxxxxxxxxxxx.dat (no boundary particles as they have slightly different values than real particles
  due to teh leap frog integration: real particles' values updated to full timestep for output,
  but boundary particles' values not!)
  (note: profile can also quickly be generated by the splash SPH visualization program)
