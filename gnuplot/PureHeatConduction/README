compProfiles.sh:
----------------
- has to be run with the timestamp of the desired instant (12 digits) as input argument
  ./compProfiles xxxxxxxxxxxx
- creates an .eps and .png called <<T_profilesxxxxxxxxxxxx._ _ _ >> for visual comparison of simu result and
  exact solution at this instant (using files <<simuForPlotxxxxxxxxxxxx.dat>> and <<exactxxxxxxxxxxxx.dat>>)

EnergyContentEvolution.sh:
--------------------------
- creates an .eps and .png called <<EnergyContentEvolution._ _ _ >> where energy content is plottetd versus simu-time
  (using file: <<energyContentEvolution.dat>>)


simulatedProfileOnly.sh:
------------------------
- has to be run with the timestamp of the desired instant (12 digits) as input argument
  ./simulatedProfileOnly xxxxxxxxxxxx
- only plots simulated profile for the desired instant in an .eps and .png file called <<T_profilexxxxxxxxxxxx._ _ _ >>
  (using file <<simuForPlotxxxxxxxxxxxx.dat>>)

ErrorResolution.sh:
-------------------
- plots the evolution of the Errors with variation of the resolution
  (using file <<ErrorResolution.dat>>, which is created manually by copying the error data from the desired simulations
   into a file called like this.)

ErrorTimestep.sh:
-------------------
- plots the evolution of the Errors with variation of the timestep dt
  (using file <<ErrorTimestep.dat>>, which is created manually by copying the error data from the desired simulations
   into a file called like this.)


tempErrEvolution.sh:
--------------------
- plots the evolution of the Errors with time 
  (using tempErrEvolution.dat)
