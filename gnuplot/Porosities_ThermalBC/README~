 
compProfiles.sh:
----------------
- has to be run with the timestamp of the desired instant (12 digits) as input argument
  ./compProfiles xxxxxxxxxxxx
- creates an .eps and .png called <<T_profilesxxxxxxxxxxxx._ _ _ >> for visual comparison of simu result and
  exact solution at this instant (using files <<simuForPlotxxxxxxxxxxxx.dat>> and <<exactxxxxxxxxxxxx.dat>>)


ErrorResolution.sh:
-------------------
- plots the evolution of the Errors with variation of the resolution
  (using file <<ErrorResolution.dat>>, which is created manually by copying the error data from the desired simulations
   into a file called like this.) (file structure: N_part, L_1, L_2, L_inf)
