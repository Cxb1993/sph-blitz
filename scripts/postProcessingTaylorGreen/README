	post-processing Taylor Green Flow 

######################################################

The simulation results are compared to the exact analytical solution
of the INCOMPRESSIBLE Taylor-Green flow. (this is justified for the
present conditions as demonstrated by Chaniotis2002, Journal of Computational Physics 182, 67â€“90)

The quality of the simulation results is measured by 
  (see papers Hu2007 (Journal of Computational Physics 227, 264-278) or
  Chaniotis2002 (see above))
- comparison of the decay in max. velocity with the theoretical decay rate
- .

Post-Processing Steps:
---------------------

1. run the shell script <<prepareDirectory.sh>> in a shell placed in this
(/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessingTaylorGreen) directory

 This will perform the following action:
 - create a new directory <<ResultsInProgress>> in sph-blitz/results
   !!!ATTENTION!!! by running this script all data possibly already existing
   in the <<ResultsInProgress>> directory will be deleted. Therefore be sure
   to save them at a different location before!!!

2. run the program <<VelocDecayAnalysisTG.cpp>> in this (/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessingTaylorGreen)
   directory
   This will determine the maximum velocity for each output time and write the results
  (time, max_vel) in a file called <<decayAnalysis.dat>> in the ResultsInProgress directory.
