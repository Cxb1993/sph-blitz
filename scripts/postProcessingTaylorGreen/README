	post-processing Taylor Green Flow 

######################################################

The simulation results are compared to the exact analytical solution
of the INCOMPRESSIBLE Taylor-Green flow. (this is justified for the
present conditions as demonstrated by Chaniotis2002, Journal of Computational Physics 182, 67â€“90)

The quality of the simulation results is measured by 
  (see papers Hu2007 (Journal of Computational Physics 227, 264-278) or
  Chaniotis2002 (see above))
- comparison of the decay in max. velocity with the theoretical decay rate
- .

Post-Processing Steps:
---------------------

1. run the shell script <<prepareDirectory.sh>> in a shell placed in this
(/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessingTaylorGreen) directory

 This will perform the following action:
 - create a new directory <<ResultsInProgress>> in sph-blitz/results
   !!!ATTENTION!!! by running this script all data possibly already existing
   in the <<ResultsInProgress>> directory will be deleted. Therefore be sure
   to save them at a different location before!!!

2. run the program <<VelocDecayAnalysisTG_const_dt.cpp>> in this (/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessingTaylorGreen)
   directory
   This will determine the maximum velocity for each output time and write the results
  (time, max_vel) in a file called <<decayAnalysis.dat>> in the ResultsInProgress directory.

    Attention, program only reads prtlxxxxxxxx.dat files with constant effective output interval, i.e. the timestep 
    has to be chosen constant. If the output interval for example is chosen 0.1 and the time step 
    is manually chosen to 0.03, then, teh effective output interval to enter for the post processing is 0.12.
    It is always the first multiple of dt, which is > output interval.
  
3. if desired: visualization with gnuplot, see <<sph-blitz/gnuplot>>
