1D stationnary wave (oscillation)
---------------------------------

1. run the shell script <<prepareDirectory.sh>> in a shell placed in this
(/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessing1DWave) directory

 This will perform the following action:
 - create a new directory <<ResultsInProgress>> in sph-blitz/results
   !!!ATTENTION!!! by running this script all data possibly already existing
   in the <<ResultsInProgress>> directory will be deleted. Therefore be sure
   to save them at a different location before!!!


2. run the c++ program <<findPeakVelocitiesOscillation>> in a shell placed in this
(/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessing1DWave) directory

  -->asks user for output interval time of underlying simulation, enter in seconds (exactly as in 
    configuration file for simulation (1DWave.tcl)
  -->processes data and creates the following outputfiles in 
    <<sph-blitz/results/ResultsInProgress>>: 
  
    - <<peakVelocities.dat>> 
    file structure:
    period number (starting at 1) | peak velocity | adimensional peak velocity=v_peak/v_peak,0|... 
    ...time | adimensional time =t/T_0|
    BE AWARE: the accuracy of the determined periodic time is biased by the output interval time!!!
	      it can never be more accurate than the output interval time for the simulation!!!

    - <<DampingPeriod.dat>> 
    file structure
    period number (starting at 1) | damping=(v_peak(i+1)-v_peak(i))/v_peak(i) |...
    ... periodic time (normalized)= (t_peak(i+1)-t_peak(i))/(t_peak(1)-t_peak(0))|
    BE AWARE: the accuracy of the determined periodic time is biased by the output interval time!!!
	      it can never be more accurate than the output interval time for the simulation!!!

3. if the visualization of the temporal evolution of velocity, pressure, density is desired,
    there are gnuplot ("movie"-) scripts in <<sph-/blitz/gnuplot/1DWave>>, see README in that folder!



1D traveling wave 
------------------

1. same as above (<<prepareDirectory.sh>>)

2. run the c++ program <<findPeakVelocitiesTravelWave>> in a shell placed in this
(/sph-blitz/scripts/postProcessing1DWave) directory
   
  it is a slightly modified version of the program above:
    - maximum search not limited any more to domain x=0->x=0.5
    - every simulation output data file is a multiple of T (see NOTE1) and therefore program can be simplified
  
  NOTE1: be sure that there are only output data files for instants which are multiples of the periodic time T
	in order for the program to calculate the damping correctly ...
  NOTE2: all the post-processing for time related data (such as T, ...) is not meaningful, as T is not "determined"
	but already given by the simulation data output interval! So it will be constant anyway...
	Nevertheless, I leave the T-data in the post-Processing output file in order that the information 
	about the T value is not lost!
