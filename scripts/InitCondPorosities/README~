1)cavity
---------
1.a)Geometrical situation:
---------------------
By default the positon of the cavity is centered inn the domain in x-direction. Therefore the geometry 
of the cavity can be entirely described by the following three parameters: 
# y_surface: the y-coordinate of the surface of the cavity
# depth: the depth of the cavity (from surface to bottom)
# width: the width of the cavity
(the origin of the coordinate system is the left-bottom corner of the domain

1.b) the initial condition generator program:
     -if desired, modify the three parametres (y_surface, depth, width) as well as other parameters (domain_size...)
     in <<create_ICCavity.cpp>>
     -type <<make>> to compile
     -run the program: <<./create_ICCavity>>
      This does the following: it creates a uniform particle distribution for the domain, i.e. the wall and fluid part
      (ghost- and real particles) are initialized with the same DURCHGEHENDEM regular particle lattice. The differnce 
      of the particle types is only made in the simulatio program, where according to the
      information (y_surface, depth, width) particles are assigned their respective type.
      The wall part of the domain does not need to be filled completely with (ghost) particles, but only to a
      distance of one smoothinglength to the wall-surface. This is taken into account by the initial condition proram
      and therefore the user is asked to provide the smoothing lenght of the simulation.
     -the initial paricle distribution as well as the information (y_surface, depth, width)
      is written into the file <<Cavity.ivs>> which is created by the program in the <<sph-blitz/cases/>> folder
      .ivs file structure:
       first line: y_surface | depth | width
       second line: N_particles
       next lines: particle information (one line for each particle): x|y|vx|vy|rho|p|m
