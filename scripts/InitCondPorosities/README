1)cavity
---------
1.a)Geometrical situation:
---------------------
By default the positon of the cavity is centered inn the domain in x-direction. Therefore the geometry 
of the cavity can be entirely described by the following three parameters: 
# y_surface: the y-coordinate of the surface of the cavity
# depth: the depth of the cavity (from surface to bottom)
# width: the width of the cavity
(the origin of the coordinate system is the left-bottom corner of the domain

1.b) the initial condition generator program:
     -if desired, modify the three parametres (y_surface, depth, width) as well as other parameters (domain_size...)
     in <<create_ICCavity.cpp>>
     -type <<make>> to compile
     -run the program: <<./create_ICCavity>>
      This does the following: it creates a uniform particle distribution for the entire domain, i.e. the wall 
      and fluid part       (ghost- and real particles) are initialized with the same DURCHGEHENDEM
      regular particle lattice. The differnce of the particle types is only made in the simulatio program,
      where according to the information (y_surface, depth, width) particles are assigned their respective type.
      The wall part of the domain does not need to be filled completely with (ghost) particles, but only to a
      distance of one smoothinglength to the wall-surface. This is only taken into account by the 
      simulation programm, which sorts out the not-needed particlles. Like this, if the smoothing length
      is changed (at constant particle spacing) one does not have to recreate a new .ivs file every time.
     -the initial paricle distribution as well as the information (y_surface, depth, width)
      is written into the file <<Cavity.ivs>> which is created by the program in the <<sph-blitz/cases/>> folder
      .ivs file structure:
       first line: y_surface | depth | width
       second line: N_particles
       next lines: particle information (one line for each particle): x|y|vx|vy|rho|p|m
